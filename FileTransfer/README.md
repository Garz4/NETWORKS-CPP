# FileTransfer

Welcome to my FileTransfer app. What it does is, basically, send, via UPD packages, the selected files.

## Getting started

All you need to do if you want to run this baby, is have g++ compiler installed in LINUX. Yes, not windows. ):
Once you have it, just download these files, put them in a folder and run the command "make" in that folder.

The name of the files that you want to send must be written in a txt file. For example:
```
Archivos.txt = "Cliente.cpp
Makefile
Mensaje.h
PaqueteDatagrama.cpp
PaqueteDatagrama.h
Respuesta.cpp
Respuesta.h
Servidor.cpp
SocketDatagrama.cpp
SocketDatagrama.h
Solicitud.cpp
Solicitud.h
"
```
Then, lastly, copy the "server" executable in the PC you want to start transfering your files and BOOM. Done.
